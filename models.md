# Hyperpedia Models

This collection of hypermedia models describes them in terms of the [Hyperpedia concepts](concepts.md), which are a fuzzy and incomplete collection of information that can be associated with links in hypermedia scenarios.

Please keep in mind that in no way any of the model descriptions presented here is intended to be exhaustive or complete. The descriptions given here _only_ focus on the hypermedia capabilities of the models, and ignore everything else.

While the following categorization is not perfect or always entirely clear, it serves as an attempt to distinguish between models that are supposed to be used directly for applications, and those that are intended to be used as components or foundations to create models which then are used for applications.
